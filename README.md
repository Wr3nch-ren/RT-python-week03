# RT-python-week03
Ray tracing course week 03

This repository is for 'Raytracing in Entertainment Industry' (01418283).
This course is set to be taught for undergrad students at Dept of Computer Science, Faculty of Science, Kasetsart University.
The codes were rewritten and modified from https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html.

**Prerequisites :**
1. C/C++ or python.
2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
3. Linear algebra for undergrad students.


**Class assignment**

1. Modify 'find_intersection()' to render a square with various sizes and locations using different 't' and 'Interval'. 
2. Modify 'find_intersection()' to render 3 squares with various sizes and locations.
3. Replace 'get_center_ray()' with 'get_ray()'. Explain the differences between (2.) and (3.).
4. Generate random rays at the same pixel using 'get_ray()' and 'samples_per_pixel'. The result from 'get_color()' is then accumulated to 'pixel_color' and scaled in 'write_to_film()'. See the difference between (3.) and (4.).
5. Draw Class diagram of the codes.
